## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt that this piece of CSS code could help make the click on the screen feel like an actual click on a button:

```css
button {
  position: relative;
  ...
  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
button:hover {
  background-color: hsl(158, 36%, 10%);
}
button:active {
  top: 1px;
}
```

### Continued development

I will love to improve my CSS layout skills using FlexBox module. And I want to improve my semantic markup that could improve my CSS.
